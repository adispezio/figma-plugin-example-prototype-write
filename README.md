![Prototype Writes](proto-write-landscape.gif)

The ability to write protoype interactions in the Figma plugin API has landed! This update allows plugins to create new prototype interactions in the editor.

### Understanding reactions
Under the hood, interactions are stored in the `reactions` array. A node can have multiple reaction objects and each is comprised of an `action` and a `trigger`. The `action` defines "what happens?" and the `trigger` defines "how will it happen?"

Here's an example `reactions` array with a single reaction:
```
[
    {
        "action": {
            "type": "NODE",
            "destinationId": "2:1",
            "navigation": "NAVIGATE",
            "transition": null,
            "preserveScrollPosition": false
        },
        "trigger": {
            "type": "ON_CLICK"
        }
    }
]
```




## Development guide

This plugin example is built using [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/) by [
Yuan Qing Lim](https://github.com/yuanqing). It's an excellent boilerplate for new Figma plugins and comes packed with a ton of useful utilities.

**Note:** This plugin uses esbuild for JavaScript bundling (built by Figma cofounder [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw)!). While fairly stable, the project is still in active development.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ‚Äì v14
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the example plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing a JavaScript bundle for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

In the Figma desktop app:

1. Open a Figma document.
2. Go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `New Plugin‚Ä¶`.
3. Click the `Click to choose a manifest.json file` box, and select the `manifest.json` file that was generated.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console in the Figma desktop app, go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `Open Console`.
